# Java-1000
## Core Java - For Beginners!

If another recuriter asks us "what our favorite
programming language is" wee geeks might finally be 
driven to seppuku... Much like a bag of golf clubs, most simply know when to use each? 

Thus I use a little Python to help me maintain the 'meta for this Java 
project. -Scripting languages are great for that type of thing. 8^)

So **feel free to [click here](./MISSIONS.md) to see that 'genned mission
index**, or run [the script](./missions.py) on your 'local if that page is slightly out-of-date...
