# Java-1000
## Core Java - For Beginners!

If another recuriter asks us "what our favorite
programming language is" wee geeks might finally be 
driven to seppuku... Much like a bag of golf clubs, most simply know 
when to use each? 

Thus I use a little Python to help me maintain the 'meta for this Java 
project. -Scripting languages are great for that type of thing. 8^)

So **feel free to [click here](./MISSIONS.md) to see that 'genned mission
index**, or run [the script](./missions.py) on your 'local if that page is 
slightly out-of-date...

### Project Notes
* Testing is the presently most critical problem in our industry. 
Hence, in this educational opportunity:
  * The code is important.
  * The testing techniques are important, as well!
* This code is free & open to all: 
  * `Fork`ing helps you keep up with all changes.
  * When I die, you'll always have your `fork`ed copy.
  * Even `clone`ers give credit, where credit is due?
* Finally, modern software developers need to know how to use GitHub...

### We suggest that Students: 

(1) `Fork` this training.

(2) `Clone` this training from that fork onto your local computer.

(3) `Commit` any changes to your local repository.

(4) `Push` your solutions back to that previously forked copy here on GitHub.

### Java Educational Groups:
If you crave everything java - _and / or have your **own** 
'stuff to share_ - then join us at the 
Javaeers Groups for [Java Training Videos](https://www.facebook.com/JavaVideos9000/)
and [Java Training, General](https://www.facebook.com/groups/javatraining9000/).

If you are looking for advanced lessons, consider joining the 
[Design, Frameworks & Threads](https://www.facebook.com/Java-Design-Frameworks-Thread-Video-Training-670850766419490) 
Group.

### Black Box Testing
Finally, yet another great way to test Java is to use Robot Framework. [Here is](https://github.com/Python3-Training/Robot-Framework/tree/main/JavaExamples) how to use RF to build, test, as well as to document our efforts using any stand-alone CLI and JDK!

### Support our efforts:
Like you, I too indeed have bills to pay as well... So you can help me help you
by [buying our training](https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-java)?

### Honorable Mention:
If you've data, the you might like my [SQLMate](https://github.com/soft9000/SQLMate-for-Java) code generator project?
