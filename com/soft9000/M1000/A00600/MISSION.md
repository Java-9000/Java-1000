# Java-1000: Core Java - For Beginners!

> _VIDEO:_ (tbd)

## Mission: Total `null` Detections
(1) Create a public, static function.
* Function to combine `Float` instances together into an additive 'expression string.'
* Inputs: `Float []`
* Processing: Convert `null` instance values to `0`.
* Processing: Re-use (2), below.
* Output: An additive expression string.

(2) Create a public, static function.
* Function to combine `float` values together into an additive 'expression string.' 
* Inputs: `float []`
* Output: An additive expression string.

(3) Create a JUnit `@Test` to exercise the above.
* Prove that instanced types (e.g `Float`) can be null.

## Bonus:
* Expand your test case to check for all `null` possibilities.
* Prove that primitive types (e.g. `float`) can / cannot be null.

## Challenge Activity:
- Provide your own implementation & test cases. 
- Support the above __Bonus__ updates.

### Files:
* `NullNasty.java`

### Notes:
- "Boxing" is the process of surrounding a primitive type with an instance of a class. 
- The process of "unboxing" is the opposite.
- Whilst an instance of a class may be set to `null`, primitive types need never be.
