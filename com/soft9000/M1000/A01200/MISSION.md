# Java-1000: Core Java - For Beginners!

> _VIDEO:_ (tbd)

## Mission: Static Class Nestings
Nesting one class within another need not be so uncommon!

In this case, when our evolvng `Nexus` exclusively requires 
the `CalcJob` instance, it is often a good time to nest 
things together.

## Bonus:

## Challenge Activity:
- Study our implementation.
  * (Work in progress)
  
- Create & test your own version:

### Files:
* `CalcNester.java`
* `Nexus.java`
* `NexusTest.java`

### Notes:
- Nested classes may be either `static` or not.
- Notice how our `static` `CalcJob` may __also__ access that private, static `Nexus.boo`. 
- Use a `static` inner-class whenever you've no need to be sure
that an instance of the 'outer' class has been created; that the 
class __instances__ are 'loosely coupled,' and / or can operate __dynamically
independent__ of each other.
