# Java-1000: Core Java - For Beginners!

> _VIDEO:_ (tbd)

## Mission: Main 'Param Meta
(1) Create a public, static `main` function to:
* Detect command-line parameters.
* Test for a 'null parameter.'
* Use explicit, as well as implicit `void` return conventions.

(2) Test the above using JUnit.

## Bonus:
* Test your own parameters by updating `MainParamTest.java`

## Challenge Activity:
- Provide your own implementation in `Challenge.java`
- Provide your own test case by updating `ChallengeTest.java`

### Files:
* `MainParam.java`
* `MainParamTest.java`
* `Challenge.java`
* `ChallengeTest.java`

### Notes:
- New 'Javaeers might like to track block endings by adding line comments.
- Parameter testing is an important way to know what our input is, as well as to prevent data processing errors!
