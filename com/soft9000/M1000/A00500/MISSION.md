# Java-1000: Core Java - For Beginners!

> _VIDEO:_ (tbd)

## Mission: StringBuffer & Integral Arrays
(1) Create a private, static function.
* Function to combine integrals together into an addive 'expression string.' (*)
* Inputs: `int []`, StringBuffer
* Output: void

(2) Create a public, static function.
* Function to re-use the above.
  * Inputs: `int ...`
* Output: String

## Bonus:
* Update our test to check for null arrays.
* Update our test case to test zero-length input arrays.
* Validate your own requirements by updating our test case.

## Challenge Activity:
- Provide your own implementation & test cases. 
- Support the above __Bonus__ updates.

### Files:
* `AddInts.java`
* `AddIntsTest.java`

### Notes:
- (*) Test case demonstrates what an 'expression string' return value should look like.
- Accepting a variable number of parameters (`int ...`) is easier to use than `int []`!
- Parameter testing is an important way to know what our input is, as well as to prevent data processing errors!
