# Java-1000: Core Java - For Beginners!

> _VIDEO:_ (tbd)

## Mission: Getting Classy
Creating class instances is a fine way to help us manage more than
any single, static, set of information. Reviewing the `CalcJob` class
therefore, notice that hiding those "nasty nulls" is just one of the 
many benefits?

## Bonus:
- [Here is](./old) a minimalist solution to the previous mission.

## Challenge Activity:
- Study our implementation.
  * Compare the [new `Nexus`](./Nexus.java) to the [old `Nexus`](./old/Nexus.java).
  * Did the new [`CalcJob` Class](./CalcJob.java) add any clarity to the `Nexus`?
  * Might we ever want to have more that a single `CalcJob` in play?
- Create & test your own version!

### Files:
* `ClassyCalc.java`
* `CalcJob.java`
* `CalcJobTest.java`
* `Nexus.java`
* `NexusTest.java`
* `old/Nexus.java`
* `old/NexusTest.java`

### Notes:
- Notice how `CalcJob` made many `Nexus` operations easier to understand?
