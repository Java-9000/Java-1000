# Java-1000: Core Java - For Beginners!

> _VIDEO:_ (tbd)

## Mission: StringBuilder
(1) Create a private, static function.
* Function to combine string parameters together.
* Inputs: `String[]`, `StringBuilder`
* Process: Add spaces between strings.
* Process: Add a newline at the end of the string.
* Output: void

(2) Create a `main`
* Check for valid parameters.
* Pass command-line parameters to the private function, above.
* Dsplay the results.

(3) Test using JUnit.

## Bonus:
* Validate your own requirements by updating our test case.

## Challenge Activity:
- Provide your own implementation & test case.

### Files:
* `StringMaker.java`
* `StringMakerTest.java`

### Notes:
- Traditionally the Java Runtime provides an empty `String[]` - never a `null` - to a console `main.` Test cases however, can so do!
- Some feel that `private` member functions need never sanity-checked their parameters. Others do not. (There are valid arguments on both sides!)
- Parameter testing is an important way to know what our input is, as well as to prevent data processing errors!
