# Java-1000: Core Java - For Beginners!

> _VIDEO:_ (tbd)

## Mission: Static Member Functions
(1) Create a private, static function.
* Function to combine string parameters together.
* Inputs: String[], StringBuilder
* Output: void

(2) Create a `main`
* Pass command-line parameters to the private function, above.
* Dsplay the results.

(3) Test using JUnit.

## Bonus:
* Validate your own requirements by updating our test case.

## Challenge Activity:
- Provide your own implementation & test case.

### Files:
* `StringMaker.java`
* `StringMakerTest.java`

### Notes:
- Traditionally the Java Runtime provides an empty `String[]` - never a `null` - to a console `main.` Test cases however, can so do!
- Parameter testing is an important way to know what our input is, as well as to prevent data processing errors!
