# Java-1000: Core Java - For Beginners!

> _VIDEO:_ (tbd)

## Mission: Nested Classes
Nesting one class within another need not be so uncommon!

In this case, when our evolvng `Nexus` exclusively requires 
the `CalcJob` instance, it is often a good time to nest 
things together.

> TODO: Work in progress!

## Bonus:
- Change the nested definition of `CalcJob` to `static`. Correct any errors.
- (Work in progress)

## Challenge Activity:
- Study our implementation.
  * (Work in progress)
  
- Create & test your own version:
  * (Work in progress)

### Files:
* `CalcNester.java`
* `Nexus.java`
* `NexusTest.java`
* `CalcJobTest.java`

### Notes:
- Notice how `CalcJob` required an instance of `Nexus` 
to be created, first?
- Nested classes may be either `static` or not.
- Notice how `CalcJob` may access that private, static `Nexus.boo`?
