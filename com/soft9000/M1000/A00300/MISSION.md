## Mission: Static Member Functions
(1) Create a private, static function.
* Function to combine string parameters together.
* Input: `String[]`
* Output: `String`

(2) Call the above from within your static `main` function.

(3) Test that `main` using JUnit.

## Bonus:
* Validate your own requirements by updating our test case.

## Challenge Activity:
- Provide your own implementation & test case.

### Files:
* `StaticOps.java`
* `StaticOpsTest.java`

### Notes:
- New 'Javaeers might like to track block endings by adding line comments.
- Parameter testing is an important way to know what our input is, as well as to prevent data processing errors!
