# Java-1000: Core Java - For Beginners!

> _VIDEO:_ (tbd)

## Mission: RPN Calculator
Now is a good time to
demonstrate how to use what we have learned to create
a 'Reverse Polish Notation' - or R.P.N - calculator.

Your mission is to create a "White Box" test:
  * Run CaclRPN.Java
  * Review the code
  * Create test cases 

## Bonus:
* Review each `NEW!` comment.
* Note how we used 
`[ArrayList](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ArrayList.html)` 
to manage the evaluation stack.

## Challenge Activity:
- Study our implementation.
- Create & test your own version!

### Files:
* `CalcRPN.java`
* `TryParsers.java`

### Notes:
- Using Scanner's `.nextLine()` allows us to read an entire line.
- Entering "EOF" on any line works on Windows, as well as elsewhere.
- Using `ArrayList` allowed us to create a list of strings from
a command-line.
- The `TryParsers` class is highly re-usable.
- `System.out.printf(...)` is worthy of a [Google](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/numberformat.html)?
