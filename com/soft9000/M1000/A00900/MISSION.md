# Java-1000: Core Java - For Beginners!

> _VIDEO:_ (tbd)

## Mission: RPN Calculator
Now is a good time to demonstrate how to use what we have learned to create
a 'Reverse Polish Notation' - or R.P.N - calculator.

Your mission is to create a "White Box" test:
  * Run CalcRPN.Java
  * Review the code
  * Create test cases 

__NOTE__: If the term "White Box Testing" is new to you, then you 
might also enjoy [Testing Success](https://www.udemy.com/course/testing-success/?referralCode=23D2EC0CEB0FFB5C65C8)?

## Bonus:
* Review each `NEW!` comment.
* Note how we used 
[`ArrayList`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ArrayList.html) 
to manage the evaluation stack.

## Challenge Activity:
- Study our implementation.
- Create & test your own version!
- Add support for:
   * Additional operations.
   * The "passing in" of expressions from the command line.
- Use JUnit to test command-line operations.
- Use a `Scanner` to support file-based testing?

### Files:
* `CalcRPN.java`
* `Nexus.java`

### Notes:
- Using Scanner's `.nextLine()` allows us to read an entire line.
- Entering "EOF" on any line works on Windows, as well as elsewhere.
- Using `ArrayList` allowed us to create a list of strings from
a command-line.
- The `Nexus` class is highly re-usable... so be SURE to test it?  8^)
- `System.out.printf(...)` is worthy of a [Google](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/numberformat.html)?
